			<h3>Marauk U</h3>
			<p style="text-indent: 3em;">
				Mrauk U, is an ancient city and situated in Rakhine State, Myanmar and it is also one of the most important site for archaeologists to observe different artifacts in the area.  Mrauk U lies Eastern Kaladan River and is surrounded by hills in both northern and southern part. 
				King Narameikhla (1404 â€“ 1434 A.D) founded Maruk Oo  and remained the same as the capital for the next 400 years. To reach to Mrauk Oo, visitors need to take boat about 5 hours from Sittwe following along the bend of the Kalatan river.  It can be said that Mrauk U is another ancient city with lots of pagodas spreading over the land just as it is in Bagan but with entirely different architecture which were built in different times back in ancient Myanmar history.
