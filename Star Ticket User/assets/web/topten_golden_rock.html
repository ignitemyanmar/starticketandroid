			<h3>Golden Rock (Kyaikhtiyo Pagoda)</h3>
			<p style="text-indent: 3em;">
				Golden Rock, in Myanmar language known as KyiteHteeYoe Pagoda is one of the breath-taking and also a sacred place for Myanmar people.  It is located in Mon State and perched on the highest mountain of Paunglaung mountain range.  To travel to KyiteHteeYoe pagoda, it will take a 4-hour drive from Yangon, where it will proceed in an open truck uphill to hermit hill.  The rock and the pagoda are at the top of Mt. Kyaiktiyo. It is the third most important Buddhist pilgrimage site in Burma after the Shwedagon Pagoda and the Mahamuni Pagoda. A glimpse of the "gravity defying" Golden Rock is believed to be enough of an inspiration for any person to turn to Buddhism.
				It is the best place for those who would like to have a legendary pilgrimage because the Golden Rock itself is placed on top of the mountain and visitors can choose whether to take a bus to go to the top of the mountain or trekking up to the mountain which will take around 5 hours while being able to enjoy various legendary milestones along the way making to the top of the mountain.
